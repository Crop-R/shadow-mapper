# Shadow Mapper

This project produces so called shadow maps, showing which parts of a geographic area that are lit by the sun and which are in shade, using open elevation data and buildings from OpenStreetMap.

[This video of shadow mapper](https://vimeo.com/98524944) shows what this project is about.

Find more information about why this project exists and how it works in my [blog post about shadow mapper](http://www.liedman.net/2014/06/25/sunshine/).
